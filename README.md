# TallyRange

A VBA function to tally the unique values in a range. Because Excel has no simple means to count unique elements of a range where not all contents of the range are known previously, Tally Range is necessary. COUNTIF cannot be used unless all unique elements of a range are listed in a separate location, which can be tedious when the data isn't known.
